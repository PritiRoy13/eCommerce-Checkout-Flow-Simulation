# eCommerce-Checkout-Flow-Simulation
This project is a front-end simulation of a simplified eCommerce checkout flow built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the essential user experience of browsing a product, customizing options (like color and quantity), and proceeding through a secure checkout process with simulated form validation and payment handling.
